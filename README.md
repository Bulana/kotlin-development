This is where I will record my lessons/mistakes I make/pickup while practicing and reminding myself of the Kotlin. 

Each chapter's lessons, key points and oh aha moments as well as mistakes will be discussed. 

The branches will be named according to the topic covered. 

I might take an kotlin exam.
